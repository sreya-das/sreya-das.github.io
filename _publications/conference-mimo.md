Stabilization of linear time-invariant multi-inputmulti-output (LTI-MIMO) systems is presented distinctively and efficiently in this paper. The idea is to decouple the system state matrix depending on different inputs and outputs using the special canonical transformation proposed. Due to the decoupled form of the observer based controller system, it’s possible to use separate transformation for observer and controller design. Since the decoupled state matrix resembles the single-input-single-output (SISO) case, the generalized equation for the system is first obtained, and then it’s extended to the MIMO system. The computational complexity in getting the controller and observer gain matrix coefficients are further reduced due to the special form of gain matrices taken.
