 Composite pulses are the efficient method for broadband excitation to get control of the limitations of high field NMR, such as resonance offset effects with constraints on rf power that leads to signal intensity distortion. Phase-modulated chirp pulses are used as ordered composite pulse sequences in this paper as CHORUS sequence in a high-field NMR spectrometer (BRUKER 750 MHz) for broadband excitation. The composite pulse sequence applies chirp pulses with the forward and the reverse sweep mechanisms. A single excitation pulse combines adiabatic and non-adiabatic rotation, explained as a three-phase rotation, which leaves the magnetizing vectors to a non-uniform phase dispersion as a function of the offset frequency. One adiabatic refocusing pulse of the double sweep rate after the excitation pulse cannot satisfactorily compensate for the phase dispersion. Hence, composite self-refocussing CHORUS excitation pulse, with forward, reverse, and their combinations are used to remove the non-uniform phase dispersion generated due to offset resonance frequency. Four such combinations of composite pulses are produced with analytical explanation in this paper. MATLAB simulation results and experimental verification on the BRUKER 750 MHz NMR spectrometer of the composite pulses are also presented in this paper.
